# Credit_Card_Approval_Prediction

This case study aims to model the status of each client in Credit Card Score data set, available on Kaggle.Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry.It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings.Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task.
